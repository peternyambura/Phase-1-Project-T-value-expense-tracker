# Expense Tracker App

The Expense Tracker App is a web-based application that allows users to manage their savings, track expenses, and categorize expenses. This application provides a user-friendly interface to input savings, record expenses with categories, and visualize savings progress through a progress bar.

## Features

1. **Savings Input and Progress Bar**: Users can input their initial savings amount and track their savings progress using a dynamic progress bar. The progress bar visually represents the ratio of current savings to the initially set savings.

2. **Expense Tracking**: Users can add expenses by providing a name, amount, and selecting a category from a dropdown list. Expenses are displayed as a list, showing the expense name, amount, and category. Each expense entry has a "Delete" button to remove the expense from the list.

3. **Category Management**: Users can manage expense categories by adding new categories. Added categories are dynamically updated in the dropdown list for expense entry and displayed in a separate list.

## Usage

   - Enter your initial savings amount in the "Initial Savings" input field.
